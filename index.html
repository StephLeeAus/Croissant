    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their historical
      crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.
